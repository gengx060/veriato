1. IDE visual studio 2015, c#.
2. Hardcoded server port to 9999, TODO: Read from config file or command line arguments.
3. It watches txt file changes on all drives in computer, and sends the encrypted information of changed txt files to server
4. Hardcoded server log file is C:\Users\Public\server.log, again this can be configurable, better to save it to database for easy management	.
   Server log file writting is atomic by lock
5. Simple encryption, server generates public and private key, sends public key to client, client sends the encrypted data with public key, server
   decrypts it with private key
   
How to use
1. Run Server project
2. Right click FileClient project, go to Debug, type in ip address of the server
	default to 127.0.0.1 if none, if fails to connect to server, FileClient will only show txt file change info to 
	command line, otherwise it will send to server.
	then run Client project
   Or, after build FileClient project, go to Debug folder, Opend a command window, type in 'FileClient 192.168.0.12' the ip is the server ip
3. modify or create a txt file on client side, a message should be generated in C:\Users\Public\server.log file on server side
	a sample entry of server.log file:  
	06/12/2016 13:42:17  ip:192.168.0.19 File: G:\s.txt   filesize: 93bytes
